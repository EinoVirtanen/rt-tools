Linux Real-Time Tools
=====================

This repository contains a collection of tools for achieving real-time
performance in Linux. It is currently focused on CPU isolation using
cgroups/cpuset.

For information about license, see LICENSE file.

The following tools are available in install/bin:

partrt        Partition the CPUs into two sets: One set for real-time
              applications and one set for the rest. The goal for this tool is
              to achive tickless execution on the real-time CPU set.
              See man page found in "doc" sub-directory for more information.

count_ticks   Counts number of ticks that occurs when executing one or several
              shell commands. Uses ftrace for this.

list2mask     Helper script intended for providing a way to give a list of CPUs
              for partrt rather than a CPU mask. Can also use nohz_full list
              given as a kernel boot parameter.

The following other directories exists:
test          This directory contains a component test script used to test
              partrt. It can be run on a limited set of targets.
              Use option "-h" to determine which targets that are supported.
install/man   Man page for partrt. Use "man -M install/man partrt" to show it
              before installation.
