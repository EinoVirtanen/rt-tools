.TH PARTRT 1 "2014-03-03" 1.0 "PARTRT"
.SH NAME
partrt - create real time CPU partitions on SMP Linux
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B partrt <options> <cmd>
.br
.B partrt [options] create [cmd-options] <cpumask>
.br
.B partrt [options] undo [cmd-options]
.br
.B partrt [options] run [cmd-options] <partition> <command>
.br
.B partrt [options] move <pid> <partition>

.SH DESCRIPTION
The purpose of
.B partrt
is to administrate CPU partitions/domains with different
requirements on OS jitter and real-time performance.
.B partrt
requires that the
Linux kernel supports SMP and cpusets. Please see the Linux cpuset
documentation for more information.
.br
When the "create" sub-command is given, a real time partition and a non-real
time partition will be created. Then
.B partrt
will try to move all tasks into the
non-real time partition. Some kernel threads have an affinity requirement that
prohibits such a move, these will be left in the cpuset root.

Read more about reducing OS jitter in the Linux kernel documentation:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-per-CPU-kthreads.txt

.SH OPTIONS
<options> can be any combinations of:
        -v      Produce informational message to stderr
        -V      Show version information and exit
        -x      Trace script execution
        -h      Show this help text and exit
        -r NAME Name the real time partition 'NAME'
                (default: rt)
        -n NAME Name the non-real time partition 'NAME'
                (default: nrt)

.SH CMD
If <cmd> is create:
.br
        Using prtrt with the create command will divide the available CPUs
        into two partitions. One partition "rt" (default name) and one
        partition "nrt" (default name). partrt will try to move sources of
        jitter from the "rt" CPUs to the "nrt" CPUs.
.br
        The old environment will be saved in /tmp/partrt_env
.br
        <cpumask>:   Mandatory cpumask that specifies CPUs for the real time
                     partition

        cmd-options:

        -b           Do not migrate block workqueue when creating a new
                     partition
        -c           Do not disable machine check (x86)
        -d           Do not defer ticks when creating a new partition
        -h           Show this help text and exit.
        -n           Disable writeback NUMA affinity
        -m           Do not delay vmstat housekeeping when creating a
                     new partition
        -r           Do not restart hotplug CPUs when creating a new
                     partition
        -t           Do not disable real-time throttling when creating a
                     new partition
        -w           Do not disable watchdog timer when creating a new
                     partition
.br
If <cmd> is undo:
.br
        Undo what the "create" command does. Will put all tasks in the root
        cpuset and change the IRQ affinities to include all CPUs.
.br
        cmd-options:
.br
        -s file      File containing environment configuration to be
                     loaded. The configuration file is normally
                     generated by the "create" sub-command
                     (/tmp/partrt_env). If no file is provided, partrt
                     will use default values for the environment.
.br
If <cmd> is run:
.br
        Run <command> with <options> on <partition>
        where <partition> is expressed as a CPUSET directory
        relative to CPUSET root.
.br
        <partition>: Name of partition to execute within.
.br
        cmd-options:
.br
        -b           Use SCHED_BATCH
        -f <prio>    Use SCHED_FIFO with RT priority <prio>
        -i           Use SCHED_IDLE
        -o           Use SCHED_OTHER
        -r <prio>    Use SCHED_RR with RT priority <prio>
.br
If <cmd> is move:
.br
        Move the task with ID PID/TID into <partition>
.br
        <pid>: PID of task to be moved
        <partition>: Name of the partition that the task should be moved to.

.SH EXAMPLE
Create RT partition on CPU 3:
.br
$ partrt create 8
.br
Run cyclictest in the RT partition:
.br
$ partrt run rt cyclictest -n -i 10000 -l 10000
.br
Move cyclictest to NRT partition:
.br
$ partrt move "pid of cyclictest" nrt
.br
Undo partitioning (restore environment)
.br
$ partrt undo
.br
